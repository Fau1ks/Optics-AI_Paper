        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup.

However, existing architectures face challenges in integrating large‐scale multidimensional metasurfaces into precise network training and haven't utilized multidimensional EM field coding schemes for super‐resolution sensing. Here, diffractive meta‐neural networks (DMNNs) are proposed for accurate EM field modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and coding for multi‐task learning and high‐throughput super‐resolution direction of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre‐trained mini‐metanets to characterize meta‐atom optical modulations across polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters designed using meta‐training. DMNN simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles through x and y‐polarizations, while the interleaving of frequency‐multiplexed angular intervals generate spectral‐encoded super‐oscillatory angular responses to achieve wide‐field super‐resolution estimation. Post‐processing lightweight fully‐connected neural networks further enhance the performance. Experimental results validate that a three‐layer DMNN operating at 27, 29, and 31 GHz achieves 0.5∘$^\\circ$ angular resolution, i.e., ∼7×$\\sim 7\\times$ the Rayleigh diffraction limit, a mean absolute error of 0.048∘$^\\circ$ for incoherent targets within ±11.5∘$\\pm 11.5^\\circ$, and an angular estimation capacity of ∼$\\sim$1917, an order of magnitude higher than that of existing methods.

This work not only provides new insights into the design of high-performance OFTS but also presents a thermo-enhanced OFTS for safety evaluation in commercial batteries.</p>"

The vortex laser demonstrates exceptional operational stability with more than 94% mode purity while supporting fast topological charge reconfiguration with mode establishment times of sub-8 ms, which is a critical capability for real-time optical encoding applications. By precisely engineering phase-dependent mode losses and exploiting the self-reconstruction properties of Talbot diffraction, our approach achieves reliable modulation of competing modes without the need for additional optical components. The generated vortex beams exhibit robust stability, repeatability, and scalability, with topological charges reconfigured via controlled phase modulation. Through information encoding in mutually orthogonal charge states, this work demonstrates robust, multichannel communication with inherent error resilience, highlighting the vortex laser's potential for high-speed optical links and quantum communication. By integrating active amplification with external mode shaping, it establishes a versatile and scalable platform for advanced structured light applications.</p>"

Tailoring energy funneling and hot carrier cooling pathways enables tunable gain characteristics in multi-quantum-well lasers.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Quasi-2D perovskites exhibit prominent optical properties, including a high exciton binding energy and inherent quantum well configurations, making them highly promising for laser applications. However, their practical implementation in multiple-quantum-well lasers is hindered by defect states and heterogeneous phase distributions. Here, it is reported that incorporating carbon dots (CDs) into quasi-2D perovskites improves crystallinity and phase uniformity, which together reduce trap-assisted recombination and suppress Auger recombination, facilitating more efficient energy funneling. Theoretical calculations reveal that passivation mechanisms and phase formation kinetics are attributed to the synergistic effects of the multifunctional groups in CDs. A reduction in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold is achieved in CDs-mediated quasi-2D perovskites. Moreover, an optical Kerr-gating technique is innovatively applied to reveal the microscopic mechanisms governing ASE evolution by elucidating the complex ultrafast carrier dynamics in multiple-quantum-well structures. The results indicate that modulation of ultrafast energy funneling and hot carrier cooling enables fine-tuning of ASE dynamics, providing a strategic pathway for tailoring the gain characteristics toward high-performance lasing. This paper presents a promising approach to improving quasi-2D perovskites as gain materials and offers valuable insights into the design of advanced photonic systems by investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales.</p>"

The concept of embedding metasurfaces into robust topological PhCs is presented for diverse wave and chirality manipulations without compromising their topological nature, contributing to a twofold topology‐functionality advantage in flat optics. By embedding tailored metasurfaces into topological PhC originating from the bound state in the continuum (BIC), chirality control, phase‐gradient wavefront engineering, and generation of exceptional points are achieved, while simultaneously preserving the momentum‐space topological singularity of BICs. This unified platform transcends the single‐functionality paradigm of topological photonics, enabling multifunctional light manipulation in compact, free‐space devices for applications in chiral sensing, vortex generation, and singular optics.",

Here, a novel pair of 0D hybrid copper halide isomers, α‐ and β‐(ETPA)2Cu2I4 (ETPA = ethyltripropylammonium) is reported, which exhibit a reversible structural phase transition and PL color switching upon heating or cooling treatment. At 298 K, α‐(ETPA)2Cu2I4 displays a single band blue emission with a near‐unity PLQY. Upon heating treatment, an additional thermally‐activated low‐energy emission band appears ≈650 nm, resulting in a dual‐band yellow emission. Conversely, this yellow emission can gradually revert to the original blue emission during a cooling process. The dynamic interconversion process between these two isomers is monitored using in situ optical and structural measurements, revealing that there are two self‐trapped emitting states in [Cu2I4]2− dimers, whose populations are strongly dependent on the surrounding molecular environment and the thermal activation energy. Moreover, the robust structural and optical reversibility over 45 cycles is demonstrated. Notably, the reversible PL switching in 0D hybrid copper halide isomers makes them promising candidates for applications in anti‐counterfeiting and thermo‐responsive scintillators.",

It enables single-pixel multispectral imaging, encrypted communication, and high-resolution scanning imaging without IR-filter removal, addressing integration challenges in autonomous driving, diagnostics, and secure optical systems.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Multispectral photodetectors (PDs) enable simultaneous photon detection across distinct bands, unlocking advanced capabilities such as precision object identification, autonomous navigation, and secure optical communication through spectral-specific signal discrimination. However, the integration of multiple spectral detection functionalities into a single device architecture remains a challenge. Here, a two-terminal, vertically stacked dual-heterostructure (DH) photodetector composed of a Te<sub>0.75</sub>Se<sub>0.25</sub>/Si/AZO (P-N-N<sup>+</sup>) configuration that achieves broadband spectral detection (300–1750 nm) under zero-bias operation while exhibiting a tunable bipolar photoresponse is presented. The device demonstrates high-performance metrics, including a specific detectivity exceeding 10<sup>11</sup> Jones, a −3 dB cutoff frequency of 280 kHz, and an ultrafast response time of 726 ns under 1550 nm illumination. The selective detection of visible (VIS) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectra is effectively adjusted by varying the applied bias voltage. Capitalizing on these rapid response and bipolar characteristics, this PD facilitates pixel-level imaging and secure optical communication with encryption capability. Furthermore, a scanning imaging system that operates without the removal of an infrared cut-filter, achieving high-quality image recognition with a grayscale resolution beyond a 9-level grayscale is demonstrated. This work provides a promising strategy for developing bias-switchable, multimodal photodetectors with diverse applications in advanced imaging and communication technologies.</p>"

Control of the shift involves both its magnitude and direction. Although resonance‐enhanced GH shift under reflection has significantly expanded and facilitated its observation and application, implementations in transmission scenarios remain scarce. More importantly, discussions on the direction of the GH shift are rare, and the associated degree of freedom for controlling directional asymmetry has not been fully explored. To address these issues, a control framework is discussed for enhancing transmitted GH shifts from symmetric to asymmetric. A design with complete degrees of freedom from symmetric shift enhancement to unidirectional shift enhancement is demonstrated in transmission scenarios. The control dimension associated with directionality significantly enhances the flexibility of beam shift control, with broad application prospects in scenarios such as high‐sensitivity sensing, precision measurement, optical isolators, and asymmetric optical switches.",

        "summary": "Near‐Infrared Organic Photodetectors (NIR‐OPDs) have garnered attention for their cost‐effective solution‐processability and unlimited molecular tunability. Recently, microcavities are integrated into NIR‐OPDs to enhance the weak absorption of charge transfer (CT) states in organic blends. These Microcavity‐Enhanced Near‐Infrared Organic Photodetectors (MC‐NIR‐OPDs) exhibit superior narrowband detection capabilities and broad application potential. However, conventional first‐order cavity modes suffer from parasitic absorption, limiting responsivity (R). Here, utilizing a second‐order resonance mode is proposed to enhance the absorption of CT states in a model system: the PM6:Y6 blend. By integrating a metal‐ dielectric (M‐D) resonant microcavity into a thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPD structure, the device achieves a remarkable 13 nm full‐width at half‐maximum (FWHM) and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 34.7% at the operating wavelength of 960 nm, significantly outperforming previous reports on PM6:Y6‐based OPDs. Concurrently, a substantial reduction in dark current to 8.4 nA cm−2 is observed, and the detectivity (D*) is enhanced to 1.12 × 1012 Jones. As a demonstration, the photodetector can accurately measure human heart rate using the photoplethysmography method, highlighting its potential for biometric recognition and wearable devices. It is anticipated that this device design strategy can also be extended to other organic systems with narrower bandgaps.",

A detailed analysis of PL and Raman spectra indicates strain-induced alterations in the optical properties of WS<sub>2</sub> monolayers. These findings suggest the potential applications of surface wave excitation in revealing the imperfections in large-area TMDCs monolayers, which is crucial for the fabrication of TMDCs-based optoelectronic devices.</p>"

This study demonstrates a high-efficiency method for steering light beam displacement at optical interfaces through polarization control using a reflective photonic crystal (PhC) slab. The reflective PhC slab enhances cross-polarization efficiency by reducing scattering channels, facilitating clear observation of beam shifts without the need for additional polarization analysis. By varying the polarization state of incident light, continuous magnitude and direction control over the beam shift at the PhC slab are achieved. In practical experiments, a maximum cross-polarized efficiency over 74%$\\%$ and the tunable displacement range reaching up to 14 wavelengths at 780 nm are realized. This work proposes an effective approach to realizing controllable beam displacement, while also inspiring future developments in precise and efficient beam steering through photonic band and polarization engineering.</p>"

This design eliminates mechanical components and lens alignment, enabling a 40°(H) × 20°(V) field of view while maintaining beam shaping and directed emission. Furthermore, the system achieves sub-millimeter 3D ranging accuracy, demonstrated through scanning of planar and stepped surfaces, with root mean square errors of &lt;360 and &lt;900 µm. An intensity-wavelength hybrid coding scheme is further applied to the 3D sensing system, which reconstructs high-density point clouds (&gt;200 pts cm<sup>−2</sup>) for a David at 1 m distance and complex scenes at 5 m distance. These advancements position the system as a transformative solution for 3D sensing in dynamic environments.</p>"

        "abstract_cn": "钙钛矿发光二极管 (PeLED) 已成为下一代发光技术，由于其卓越的色纯度、可调谐的发射光谱和经济高效的溶液加工制造方法，在显示和照明应用中展现出巨大的潜力。最近的进展导致外部量子效率 (EQE) 显着提高，最先进的设备超过 30%。尽管如此，运行稳定性仍然是阻碍商业化的主要瓶颈。钙钛矿薄膜的快速降解和载流子损失是影响性能的关键因素，而结晶质量差、非辐射复合缺陷、离子迁移和界面反应等问题经常被认为是导致器件不稳定的主要原因。在这篇综述中，首先总结了 PeLED 的降解机制。然后，从高质量钙钛矿发光层的制备和缺陷钝化、抑制离子迁移和提高界面稳定性等角度，综述了近年来在提高PeLED性能和稳定性方面的研究进展。也总结了对不同推广方式的深刻理解。这些结果对于PeLED的未来发展和商业应用具有一定的指导意义。"
