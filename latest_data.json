        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

            "value": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation.

However, existing architectures face challenges in integrating large‐scale multidimensional metasurfaces into precise network training and haven't utilized multidimensional EM field coding schemes for super‐resolution sensing. Here, diffractive meta‐neural networks (DMNNs) are proposed for accurate EM field modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and coding for multi‐task learning and high‐throughput super‐resolution direction of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre‐trained mini‐metanets to characterize meta‐atom optical modulations across polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters designed using meta‐training. DMNN simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles through x and y‐polarizations, while the interleaving of frequency‐multiplexed angular intervals generate spectral‐encoded super‐oscillatory angular responses to achieve wide‐field super‐resolution estimation. Post‐processing lightweight fully‐connected neural networks further enhance the performance. Experimental results validate that a three‐layer DMNN operating at 27, 29, and 31 GHz achieves 0.5∘$^\\circ$ angular resolution, i.e., ∼7×$\\sim 7\\times$ the Rayleigh diffraction limit, a mean absolute error of 0.048∘$^\\circ$ for incoherent targets within ±11.5∘$\\pm 11.5^\\circ$, and an angular estimation capacity of ∼$\\sim$1917, an order of magnitude higher than that of existing methods.
